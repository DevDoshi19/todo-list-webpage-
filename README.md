Project Title: Dynamic To-Do List Web App

Description:
I developed a dynamic To-Do List web application that offers users an intuitive and interactive way to manage their daily tasks. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this app focuses on a seamless user experience with features such as task creation, editing, and deletion.

Key Features:

Task Management: Users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task can be marked as completed, with completed tasks automatically updating the progress bar.
Persistent Data Storage: Leveraging localStorage, the app ensures that users' tasks are saved and available even after the browser is closed, providing a consistent experience across sessions.
Visual Feedback: The app features a dynamic progress bar that updates as tasks are completed, and a confetti animation celebrates when all tasks are done, adding an element of fun and motivation.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices.
Technologies Used:

JavaScript: Core functionality for task management, state updates, and DOM manipulation.
HTML/CSS: Structured and styled the user interface, focusing on accessibility and user-friendly design.
LocalStorage: Implemented persistent data storage to retain tasks between sessions.
Confetti Animation: Added a celebratory effect using the tsparticles confetti library for visual engagement.
This project showcases my ability to build functional, user-centered web applications with attention to detail and user experience.
